//! Sound cues: short, soft sounds for things that happen in a call.
//!
//! Every cue is synthesised here from a few enveloped partials, so Raven owns all of
//! them and ships no sound files. A cue is rendered whole, off the audio thread, at the
//! speaker's rate; the output callback only adds finished samples into the mix bus (see
//! `playback.rs`). Cues therefore follow the chosen speaker, and because they are mixed
//! in before the render reference is taken, echo cancellation knows about them and
//! removes them from the microphone like any other sound Raven plays. They never enter
//! a capture path or a published track.
//!
//! Three small pieces decide whether a cue plays:
//! - [`SoundCueSettings`]: the user's switches and volume, pushed from the app.
//! - [`CueGate`]: settings, deafen and debouncing.
//! - [`PresenceCues`]: turns the audio room's participant events into "joined" and
//!   "left" cues without a burst on joining, on a reconnect, or when someone's own
//!   client reconnects.
